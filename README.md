This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# Getting Started

# Please refer to https://game-trees.vercel.app/ for production build.

## Prerequisite:

1. Have node and npm available to run code.
2. MySQL is running with the database setup already.

   - (_OPTIONAL_) _To allow uploading images from MySQL commands (not our project), please follow the correct directions available for your device on the MySQL documentation. This is due to how MySQL has handles privacy and security._

3. Use npm run dev via the terminal in the cloned directory of this project. (Ensure that you are on localhost port 3000, if not there will be conflicts with what is in the `.env` file)
4. Go to the `localhost:3000`

## Install Dependencies (options that are known to work with Node.js)

### Install npm (comes with Node.js)

node -v # Check Node.js is installed

### Install yarn

npm install -g yarn

### Install pnpm

npm install -g pnpm

### Install bun

curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install

npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
# or
bun build

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## `.env.local` Setup

Copy the template below into a new `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and replace the placeholder values with your own local database credentials.

```
# MySQL Local
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASS=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name

# Next-Auth (API Keys)
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
AUTH_SECRET= CHECK YOUR EMAIL TA/PROFESSOR

# OAuth Providers
GOOGLE_ID= CHECK YOUR EMAIL TA/PROFESSOR
GOOGLE_SECRET= CHECK YOUR EMAIL TA/PROFESSOR

DISCORD_ID= CHECK YOUR EMAIL TA/PROFESSOR
DISCORD_SECRET= CHECK YOUR EMAIL TA/PROFESSOR

GITHUB_ID= CHECK YOUR EMAIL TA/PROFESSOR
GITHUB_SECRET= CHECK YOUR EMAIL TA/PROFESSOR
```

# Create schema and populate local data

Images cannot be shown due to MySQL settings in my.ini and my.cnf

```bash
cd documents\database
MySQL -u root -p
```

```MySQL
source createdb.sql;

-- Optional queries to populate photos
source loadAccPicturesTestMAC.sql;
# or
source loadAccPicturesTest.sql;

source loadGamePicturesTestMAC.sql;
# or
source loadGamePicturesTestWINDOWS.sql;

source loadAccPicturesTestMAC.sql;
# or
source loadAccPicturesTestWINDOWS.sql;

source loadStorePicturesTest.sql;
```
